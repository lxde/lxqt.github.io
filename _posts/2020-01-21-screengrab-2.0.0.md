The LXQt team is proud to announce the release of ScreenGrab 2.0.0

This release opens the 2.0 release cycle. Most of the changes in this release are purely technical; visible changes are the improved screen areas instructions, better screenshots of off-screen windows and less noise when started from terminal. We also improved the translations and added a few new languages.

The release can be downloaded from [downloads.lxqt.org](https://downloads.lxqt.org/current.html) or [Github](https://github.com/lxqt/screengrab/releases)
